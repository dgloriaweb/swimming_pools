## Public intro, info and disclaimer
This is an experimental application, please don't misuse it. Each user has 3 questions per day  they can fill in to avoid biased responses.
Our aim is to provide feedback of the facility users to the centre managements.
Please specify which kind of swimmer you are: Lane swimmer, other.
The data collection is anonym. If you'd like to contact the developers, please write to sacred.affection@gmail.com 
The reports aren't public at the moment. As soon as enough data is available of the centres we will consider some sort of reporting without showing the names of the centres.

## difficult stuff
